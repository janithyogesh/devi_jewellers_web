### How to Use

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the project files and place them in a folder on your computer.
2.  **Add Your Assets:** Place your logo, product photos, and other images in the `images/` folder. Ensure the filenames match the ones referenced in the `index.html` file (e.g., `logo.png`, `ring.jpg`).
3.  **Open the Website:** Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the website.

### Customization

* **Content:** Edit the text content directly in `index.html` to update product descriptions, business hours, and contact information.
* **Styling:** Modify `css/style.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout styles. The CSS file is well-commented to help you identify different sections.
* **JavaScript:** `js/script.js` handles the page's functionality. You can modify the loading screen message, animations, and form behavior.

### Note on Google Maps

The contact page uses an `iframe` to embed a live Google Map. The URL in the `src` attribute is for the specific location provided. You do not need a separate API key for this functionality.
